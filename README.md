## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Real-Time Quota & Rolling Limits
- **Live Subscriber Rate Limits**: Directly queries OpenAI's real-time rate limit engines to display accurate weekly and 5-hour `Used %` / `Remaining %` windows on active ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise accounts when available.
- **Banked Resets**: Subscriber accounts show available banked usage-limit resets when the WHAM response provides them.
- **Dynamic Reset Countdown**: Real-time timers showing the exact duration until rate limit windows roll over.
- **Platform API Keys**: Tracks token-per-minute (TPM) and request-per-minute (RPM) limits with detailed metric meters.

### 🔑 Seamless Device Code Authorization
- **Official Codex Flow**: Sign in using standard OAuth device authorization (`https://auth.openai.com/codex/device`) with automatic PKCE exchange.
- **Zero API Key Leakage**: No need to generate raw API secrets or manage complex tokens manually.

### 📅 Subscription Expiration & Renewal Tracking
- **Renewal Timers**: View exact renewal and expiry dates, billing cycles (monthly/yearly), and auto-renewal statuses.
- **Account Metadata**: View account registration dates, linked emails, and workspace IDs.

### 📱 Android Home-Screen Widgets
- **Jetpack Glance**: Modern, responsive Material 3 home-screen widgets providing real-time quota gauges and reset timers directly on your launcher.

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security & Privacy
- **Hardware-Backed Keystore**: All credentials and tokens are encrypted on-device via **AES-256-GCM** backed by the Android Keystore system.
- **Zero Telemetry**: Completely tracker-free with zero third-party analytics or remote logging.
- **Direct HTTPS**: App communicates exclusively with OpenAI servers with no intermediate proxies.

## 🛠️ Building From Source

### Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or JDK 21
- Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2.1+) or Gradle 8.11+
- Android SDK Platform 35

### Clone & Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/boudywho/codex-quota-android.git
cd codex-quota-android

# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Assemble Debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Output APK location:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Debug builds and unit tests do not require release signing credentials.

### Release Signing

Release APKs must be signed with the production certificate. Create an ignored
`signing.properties` file in the repository root with this shape (use your real
values locally; do not commit the file or keystore):

```properties
storeFile=path/to/release.keystore
storePassword=your-store-password
keyAlias=your-key-alias
keyPassword=your-key-password
```

`storeFile` may be an absolute path or a path relative to the repository root.
Each property can be overridden by its corresponding environment variable:

| `signing.properties` | Environment variable |
| :--- | :--- |
| `storeFile` | `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE` |
| `storePassword` | `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` |
| `keyAlias` | `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` |
| `keyPassword` | `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` |

Build a production APK with `./gradlew assembleRelease`. The build fails with a
clear error if any signing value is missing or the configured keystore file is
unavailable; it never falls back to the Android debug certificate.

> **One-time signing migration:** APKs previously distributed by CI were signed
> with the Android debug certificate. Android cannot upgrade those installations
> with the new production certificate, so users of an old APK must uninstall it
> once before installing the first production-signed release. After that migration,
> future releases signed with the same production certificate can update each other.

### CI and Releases

Pull requests targeting `main` and pushes to `main` run unit tests, Android lint,
and a debug APK build. To enable tagged releases, configure these GitHub Actions
repository secrets:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: the production keystore file encoded as base64
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: the keystore password
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: the signing key alias
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: the signing key password

To publish a release, first set `versionName` and `versionCode` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`, then push a matching `v*` tag (for example, `v1.2.0` for
`versionName = "1.2.0"`). The tag workflow verifies the match before handling
signing material, decodes the keystore only into the runner's temporary directory,
builds the signed release APK, and attaches `codex-quota-vX.X.X.apk` to the GitHub
Release.
